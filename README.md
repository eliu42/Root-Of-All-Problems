# Root-Of-All-Problems
An open source startup used in order to track any and all of everyone's problems. Small problems may affect many people and big problems may affect few people. What we are trying to do is find the order of problems in which to solve based on the amount of affect of all problems. Problems will be given a points. Point y: the total number of points rated as a problem. Point x: the number deemed as a problem. Total will x/y.
