# Root-Of-All-Problems
Hello to who it may concern:

I am working on a project that is a problem database that stores the problems of everyone in the world.

How it works: Each person writes their problems and gives them a rating out of a total number of points, points which I call points of innovation potential. For example, a person can rate a problem of losing a job as X out of Y points.

If multiple people have the same problem, then the summation of all total problems' points are added together, for the final points of innovation potential.

We can sort these problems by their point of innovation and decide which problems we want to solve.

Any project design outlook or frameworks and languages to use to create this project is deeply appreciated! I am making this open-source in case you wanted to join me in creating this project. Thank you for your time.
